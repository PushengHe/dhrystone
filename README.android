# Dhrystone for Android

This is an Android-compatible version of the Dhrystone 2.2 benchmark, modified to build with the Android build system.

## Building

To build the Dhrystone benchmark for Android:

1. Place this directory in the Android source tree under `external/dhrystone-master`
2. Build using the Android build system:
   ```
   m dhrystone dhrystone_reg dhrystone_opt
   ```

## Variants

Three variants of the benchmark are provided:

1. `dhrystone` - Standard version
2. `dhrystone_reg` - Version with register optimization (-DREG)
3. `dhrystone_opt` - Version with additional compiler optimizations

## Running

To run the benchmark on an Android device:

1. Push the binary to the device:
   ```
   adb push $OUT/vendor/bin/dhrystone /vendor/bin/
   ```

2. Run the benchmark:
   ```
   adb shell /vendor/bin/dhrystone [number_of_runs]
   ```

   Where `[number_of_runs]` is an optional parameter specifying the number of iterations (default: 50000).

## Notes

- The HZ value is set to 100 by default for Android. If your device uses a different value, you may need to adjust this in the code or pass it as a compile-time definition.
- Results are output to both stdout and stderr. The final benchmark results go to stdout, while validation information goes to stderr.
- For meaningful results, ensure the device is in a stable thermal state and not running other CPU-intensive tasks.
